# Cloud-Drive

An implementation of a client-server program to transfer files between different devices using a TCP server.

First, every user sign-up into the server and gets his unique id number.

With this ID, the user can log in from different devices.

The client chooses a target folder that is uploaded to the server and synced as changes occur in it. These changes are being updated on every device the user has, which allows him to transfer files between different devices.
